Searching :
    -> Searching is the process of finding some particular element in the list.
    -> Process returns the location of that element.
    -> Searching Algorithm are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
Searching Algorithms basicaly are two types:
    1-> Sequential Search:
        - The array or list is traversed seqentially and every element is checked.
        - Search an element from Unordered list.
        - Example: Linear Search.
    2-> Interval Search:
        - Saerching in sorted data structure.
        - Much more efficient than Linear Search.
        - They repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.
        - Example: Binary Search.
